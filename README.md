# HUSH 2.0.0

## What is HUSH?

![Logo](doc/hush/hush.png "Logo")

HUSH (formerly Zdash) is a code fork of [ZCash](https://z.cash/) which has it's own genesis block.
Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata.

This software is the HUSH node and command-line client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of HUSH transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

**HUSH is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk!

Deprecation Policy

is an automatic deprecation shutdown feature which will halt the node some
time after this 52 week time period. The automatic feature is based on block
height and can be explicitly disabled.

Where do I begin?
-----------------
As a reference a guide for joining the main Zcash network may be used:
https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide#using-zcash
Users should *not* follow this guide blindly since it applies to ZCash instead of HUSH!
The section of using the command line is relevant to HUSH.
